In 1785, \\nmimosa trees were introduced to North America, far \\nfrom any B. terrenus. \\nBut evolutionary links between \\npredators and their prey can persist across centuries \\nand continents. Around \\n2001, B. terrenus was \\nintroduced in southeastern North America near \\nwhere botanist Shu-Mei Chang and colleagues had \\nbeen monitoring mimosa trees. Within a year, \\n93 percent of the trees had been attacked by the \\nbeetles. \\nWhich \\nchoice best describes the function of the third \\nsentence in the overall structure of the text? \\nA) It states the hypothesis that Chang and \\ncolleagues had set out to investigate using \\nmimosa trees and B. terrenus. \\nB) It presents a generalization that is exemplified \\nby the discussion of the mimosa trees and \\nB. terrenus. \\nC) It offers an alternative explanation for the \\nfindings of Chang and colleagues. \\nD) It provides context that clarifies why the species \\nmentioned spread to new locations. \\nUnauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. 5 CONTINUE \\n...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\nModule \\n1 \\n9 \\nText 1 \\nConventional wisdom long held that \\nhuman \\nsocial systems evolved in stages, beginning with \\nhunter-gatherers forming small bands of members \\nwith roughly equal status. The shift to agriculture \\nabout 12,000 years ago sparked population growth \\nthat led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical \\nstructures: associations of clans first, then chiefdoms, \\nand finally, bureaucratic states. \\nText 2 \\nIn a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and \\narchaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans \\nhave always been socially flexible, alternately forming \\nsystems based on hierarchy and collective ones with \\ndecentralized leadership. The authors point to \\nevidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some \\nhunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures \\nseasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but \\nalso assembling into communities that included \\nesteemed individuals. \\nBased on the texts, how would Graeber and \\nWengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the \\n“conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1? \\nA) By conceding the importance of hierarchical \\nsystems but asserting the greater significance of \\ndecentralized collective societies \\nB) By disputing the idea that developments in social \\nstructures have followed a linear progression \\nthrough distinct stages \\nC) By acknowledging that hierarchical roles likely \\nweren’t a part of social systems before the rise of \\nagriculture \\nD) By challenging the assumption that groupings of \\nhunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms \\nof social structure \\n...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\n10 \\nThe following text is adapted from Frances Hodgson \\nBurnett’s 1911 novel The Secret Garden. \\nMary, a \\nyoung girl, recently found an overgrown hidden \\ngarden. \\nMary was an odd, determined little person, \\nand now she had something interesting to be \\ndetermined about, she was very much absorbed, \\nindeed.

Buck is a sled dog \\nliving with John Thornton in Yukon, Canada. \\nThornton alone held [Buck]. The rest of \\nmankind was as nothing. Chance travellers \\nmight praise or pet him; but he was cold under it \\nall, and from a too demonstrative man he would \\nget up and walk away. When Thornton’s \\npartners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the \\nlong-expected raft, Buck refused to notice them \\ntill he learned they were close to Thornton; after \\nthat he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, \\naccepting favors from them as though he favored \\nthem by accepting. \\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text? \\nA) Buck has become less social since he began living \\nwith Thornton. \\nB) Buck mistrusts humans and does his best to \\navoid them. \\nC) Buck has been especially well liked by most of \\nThornton’s friends. \\nD) Buck holds Thornton in higher regard than any \\nother person. \\nUnauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. 7 CONTINUE \\n...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\n--- US States with the Greatest Number of \\nOrganic Farms in 2016 \\n   State \\nModule \\n1 \\n---------~ \\n13 \\nOrganic farming is a method of growing food that \\ntries to reduce environmental harm by using natural \\nforms of pest control and avoiding fertilizers made \\nwith synthetic materials. Organic farms are still a \\nsmall fraction of the total farms in the United States, \\nbut they have been becoming more popular. \\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture, in \\n2016 California had between 2,600 and 2,800 organic \\nfarms and _______ \\nWhich choice most effectively uses data from the \\ngraph to complete the text? \\nA) Washington had between 600 and 800 organic \\nfarms. \\nB) New York had fewer than 800 organic farms. \\nC) Wisconsin and Iowa each had between 1,200 and \\n1,400 organic farms. \\nD) Pennsylvania had more than 1,200 organic \\nfarms. \\n...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\n14 \\nBiologist Valentina Gómez-Bahamón \\nand her team \\nhave investigated two subspecies of the fork-tailed \\nflycatcher \\nbird that live in the same region in \\nColombia, but one subspecies migrates south for part \\nof the year, and the other doesn’t. The researchers \\nfound that, due to slight differences in feather shape, \\nthe feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher \\nmales make a sound during flight that is higher \\npitched than that made by the feathers of \\nnonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize \\nthat fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the \\nspecific sound made by the males of their own \\nsubspecies, and that over time the females’ \\npreference will drive further genetic and anatomical \\ndivergence between the subspecies. \\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support \\nGómez-Bahamón \\nand her team’s hypothesis? \\nA) The feathers located on the wings of the \\nmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers have a narrower \\nshape than those of the nonmigratory birds, \\nwhich allows them to fly long distances. \\nB) Over several generations, the sound made by the \\nfeathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers \\ngrows progressively higher pitched relative to \\nthat made by the feathers of nonmigratory \\nmales. \\nC) Fork-tailed flycatchers communicate different \\nmessages to each other depending on whether \\ntheir feathers create high-pitched or low-pitched \\nsounds. \\nD) The breeding habits of the migratory and \\nnonmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers remained \\ngenerally the same over several generations. \\nUnauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. 8 CONTINUE\\nModule \\n1 \\n--- ---\\nI I I I I I \\n15 \\nAblation Rates for Three Elements in Cosmic Dust, by \\nDust Source \\nElement SPC AST HTC OCC \\niron 20% 28% 90% 98% \\npotassium 44% 74% 97% 100% \\nsodium 45% 75% 99% 100% \\nEarth’s atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic dust \\noriginating \\nfrom several sources: short-period \\ncomets (SPCs), particles from the asteroid belt \\n(ASTs), Halley-type comets (HTCs), and Oort cloud \\ncomets (OCCs).

Regardless of \\nthe reasons, art collectives usually involve some \\ncollaboration among the artists. Based on a recent \\nseries of interviews with various art collectives, an \\narts journalist claims that this can be difficult for \\nartists who are often used to having sole control over \\ntheir work. \\nWhich quotation from the interviews best illustrates \\nthe journalist’s claim? \\nA) “The first collective I joined included many \\namazingly talented artists, and we enjoyed each \\nother’s company, but because we had a hard time \\nsharing credit and responsibility for our work, \\nthe collective didn’t last.” \\nB) “We work together, but that doesn’t mean that \\nindividual projects are equally the work of all of \\nus. Many of our projects are primarily the \\nresponsibility of whoever originally proposed the \\nwork to the group.” \\nC) “Having worked as a member of a collective for \\nseveral years, it’s sometimes hard to recall what it \\nwas like to work alone without the collective’s \\nsupport. But that support encourages my \\nindividual expression rather than limits it.” \\nD) “Sometimes an artist from outside the collective \\nwill choose to collaborate with us on a project, \\nbut all of those projects fit within the larger \\nthemes of the work the collective does on its \\nown.” \\nUnauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. 9 CONTINUE \\n...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\nModule \\n1 \\n-----\\n17 \\nEffects of Mycorrhizal Fungi on 3 Plant Species \\nPlant \\nspecies \\nMycorrhizal \\nhost \\nAverage mass of plants \\ngrown \\nin soil containing \\nmycorrhizal fungi \\n(in grams) \\nAverage mass of plants \\ngrown in soil treated \\nto kill fungi (in grams) \\nCorn yes 15.1 3.8 \\nMarigold yes 10.2 2.4 \\nBroccoli no 7.5 7 \\nMycorrhizal fungi in soil benefits many plants, substantially increasing \\nthe mass of some.
