Test-Taking Information How Can the SAT Serve You?
Test-Taking Information
How Can the SAT Serve You?
When surveyed, more than 80% of students say they want the option to submit test 
scores to colleges and universities. Most colleges and universities, including those that 
are test optional, continue to value SAT
®
 scores as one part of the admissions process. 
By taking the SAT, you can apply to universities in the United States and around the 
world. Taking the SAT is also a great way to find out how prepared you are for college, 
career, or whatever your path after high school is.
Many students find that their test scores confirm their high school grades or can even 
show their strengths beyond what their grades show. Learn more at sat.org/whytake.
What to Expect from this Guide
This SAT Student Guide includes everything you need to know before, during, and after 
test day, such as:
  An introduction to the Bluebook™ testing application.
  Registration and accommodation information, as well as resources and policies.
  How to practice and prepare for the test.
  Details about how the test is structured.
  Lists for test day items and testing guidelines.
  How to understand and use your scores.
  The SAT Testing Rules.
  You will be required to review and agree to the SAT Testing Rules on page 22 during 
registration for the test and in Bluebook before you can take the test. You should review 
the SAT Testing Rules on page 22 ahead of time. They are available at sat.org/terms.
What to Know About the Test
The SAT Suite, including the SAT, measures the skills and knowledge that students like 
you are learning in school and that matter most for college and career readiness.
The SAT is scored on a 400–1600 point scale. The 2 sections of the SAT—(1) Reading 
and Writing and (2) Math—include:
  Use of reading/writing passages that come from different subject areas and vary 
in difficulty level.
  Emphasis on showing command of evidence, both textual and quantitative.
  Emphasis on high-utility words and phrases in context.
  Focus on revising texts to improve the effectiveness of written expression and to meet 
specific rhetorical goals.
  Measurement of ability to edit texts to follow core conventions of Standard English 
sentence structure, usage, and punctuation.
  Focus on the math that matters most for college and career readiness and success.
  Math problems in (and out of) context.
  Use of both multiple-choice and student-produced response question formats in the 
Math section.
  The SAT takes about 2 hours and 14 minutes to complete. It is designed to give you enough 
time on each question to measure your skills and knowledge, rather than your test-taking 
speed. The reading passages are short and have just 1 question each. Additionally, you can 
use a calculator on the entire Math section (Bluebook includes a built-in calculator).
2Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
Test-Taking Information How the SAT Is Organized
How the SAT Is Organized
The SAT Suite uses multistage adaptive testing. Both the Reading and Writing section and 
the Math section are divided into 2 equal-length and separately timed parts, called modules. 
The first module contains a mix of easy, medium, and hard questions. Based on how you 
perform on the first module, the second module of questions will either be more difficult or 
less difficult overall, but will still contain a mix of easy, medium, and hard questions.
Having a personalized test that adapts to your performance level results in a more 
efficient assessment of your academic strengths. Additionally, you can navigate freely 
within each module by previewing upcoming questions or returning to earlier questions 
(as time permits).
This type of adaptive testing allows for a much shorter, but just as reliable, assessment 
that delivers accurate scores more efficiently.
The test breaks down like this:
TEST ORGANIZATION
Section Time Allotted (min.) Number of Questions
Reading and Writing 64 54
Math 70 44
You must complete all sections of the test based on your approved timing. If you have 
been approved for extended time (up to time and one-half, up to double time, or more), 
you have the option of moving to the next part of the test before your full extended 
time expires, once the standard testing time has passed. For more information, see 
Accommodations and Digital Testing on page 5. If you leave before dismissal, your 
test may be considered incomplete or may be subject to cancellation. Do not close your 
laptop lid or cover or turn off your tablet screen at any point until you are dismissed.
Bluebook Digital Testing
Bluebook is the custom-built application you’ll use to take the SAT. Developing our own 
custom app has allowed College Board to adapt to changes and respond quickly to user 
feedback. This app has many features that you’ll find useful, including a test preview 
that can help you familiarize yourself with key aspects of the app before the test. Visit 
bluebook.app.collegeboard.org to download the app and for installation instructions.
Bluebook Tools
Bluebook includes plenty of test tools. Here are some examples:
  Mark for review: You can flag and return to any question within a given test module that 
you want to come back to later.
  Testing timer: A clock counts down the time remaining in each module. You can hide 
the timer, and you get an alert when 5 minutes remain in the module. When there are 
only 5 minutes remaining, the clock can no longer be hidden.
  Calculator: A built-in Desmos calculator is available for the entire Math section. The 
calculator is provided in the Bluebook practice test to allow you to practice with it before 
the test. (You can also bring your own acceptable calculator; please see sat.org/calculator 
for complete information.)
  Line reader: Use this tool to focus as you read test content.
  Reference sheet: On the Math section, you have access to a list of common formulas.
  Highlights & Notes: On non-math questions, you can highlight any part of a passage 
and leave yourself a note. You can change the highlight color, add an underline, make a 
note, or delete the highlight. Please note that if you are testing on a Windows tablet, it 
may be challenging to use this feature unless you are also using a keyboard.
3Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
Test-Taking Information Bluebook Digital Testing
  Option eliminator: If you think an answer option is wrong, you can cross it out.
  Question menu: Students can see which questions they skipped or marked for review 
and navigate to any question in the module.
You can use keyboard shortcuts on laptops or pinch and zoom on tablets to get a closer 
look at any part of the question, and you can set up your device before testing to use 
color contrast.
Testing Devices
You can take the SAT on a wide range of devices, including a personal or school-
managed Windows laptop or tablet, personal or school-managed Mac laptop, personal or 
school-managed iPad, or school-managed Chromebook.
IMPORTANT: Download the exam app onto your device before test day. If you are taking 
the test on a device managed by your school, ask your school’s technology department 
to install the app and adjust the device settings for you. For more information on 
downloading Bluebook on school-managed devices, visit bluebook.collegeboard.org/
students/prepare-device-for-sat-weekend.
Your device must also be able to connect to Wi-Fi, especially Wi-Fi beyond your home and 
school, and be charged enough to stay on for roughly 3 hours. We recommend you bring a 
power cord or portable charger, but we can’t guarantee you’ll have access to an outlet.
You are permitted to bring an external mouse for your device and an external keyboard if 
your device is a tablet. For Windows tablets, external keyboards are required if you want 
to use the Highlights & Notes tool. You can’t bring detachable device privacy screens. 
All other applications and programs must be closed during the test, including writing 
assistants. You can’t test on multiple devices.
If you don’t have access to a device, you can request to borrow one from College Board. You 
may qualify to borrow a testing device from College Board if you submit a request with your 
test registration before the deadline. You must register and complete the device request at 
least 30 days before the test date. Bluebook will be preinstalled on these loaned devices.
If you participate in the device lending program, you’ll arrive at the test center 30 minutes 
earlier than other students on test day in order to receive your borrowed device, complete 
exam setup, and finish the check-in process.
See If You Need to Borrow a Device on page 6 for more information.
IMPORTANT: It’s critical that Bluebook is downloaded in advance and that you check in 
on the device you’ll test with. If you use a different device on test day, you will need to 
complete the check-in process again.
Digital Testing Disruptions
An internet connection is required to start the test, but Bluebook will keep running even 
if your connection drops momentarily. If your device battery runs down, you can simply 
plug in, restart your device, and pick up where you left off—all your work will be saved, 
and you won’t lose testing time. At the end of the test, if you’re still offline and your 
answer submission fails, you’ll have until 11:59 p.m. local time the next day to get back 
online and submit your answers. If your answer submission fails on a device borrowed 
from College Board, don’t leave the test center until it submits successfully (you or your 
test coordinator can call Customer Service).
If the app crashes during your exam, just relaunch it and hit Resume Testing. Raise your 
hand so the proctor can approve your re-entry, and you’ll return to the question you were 
on. The testing timer will be paused until you resume testing.
4Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
Before Test Day Registering and Exam Setup for the Test
Before Test Day
To take the SAT, you need to:
  Register for the test on My SAT.
  Ensure you have an acceptable device to test on.
  Become familiar with Bluebook before test day. See more under Prepare for the 
SAT on page 11.
  Complete exam setup in Bluebook before test day (or immediately after receiving a 
borrowed device).
Use the information in this section to register for the test, learn about accommodations, 
and prepare to test with Bluebook.
Registering and Exam Setup for the Test
Register online for the SAT at My SAT by signing in with your free College Board 
account. If you don’t have an account yet, create one. At least five days before you test, 
you'll need to upload a photo of yourself to your registration in My SAT. This photo will 
be used to identify you on test day. Once you’re registered to take the test, you’ll see a 
test card in Bluebook five days before your test date. If it’s within five days of your test, 
and it’s not showing up in the app, please contact Customer Service.
Within the five days before you test, you’ll log in to Bluebook to complete a quick exam 
setup as just described. This step must be completed to check in for testing. You’ll watch 
a short video, then you’ll be asked to confirm your information, to read and agree to 
the SAT Testing Rules, and complete a device check. At the end of exam setup, the app 
generates your admission ticket. You can take a picture of the ticket, email the ticket to 
yourself, or print it for presenting to the testing staff for admission to the center. You 
must complete exam setup before test day to confirm your device supports the app and to 
generate your admission ticket for test day check-in. If you don’t follow these steps prior 
to test day, you may be turned away.
If You Need Testing Accommodations
If you have a disability that requires accommodations such as a screen reader, extra breaks, 
or permission to test blood sugar, be sure to have your school request College Board 
approval at least seven weeks before the test date you need the accommodations for. 
Requests for accommodations are handled by the College Board Services for Students 
with Disabilities (SSD) office. For more information about requesting accommodations and 
timing, visit our Advice for Students and Families webpage.
Timing accommodations, such as extended time testing or extra breaks, will be 
enabled in your digital exam with your approved amount of time per section. Others 
don’t affect the format of your digital test, such as permission for small-group testing, 
food/drink/medication, and permission to test blood sugar.
Some accommodations that require College Board approval for paper tests, such as 
some AP
®
 subjects, are available in Bluebook for all students. This includes zoom and 
color contrast.
When considering accommodations, note the following:
  Work with your school’s SSD coordinator or counselor for accommodations requests. 
Your SSD coordinator or other appropriate school staff can help determine what 
accommodations are best for you and submit a request online.
  The quickest and most efficient way to request accommodations is to work with your 
school. However, if you want to request accommodations without your school, download 
and submit a Student Eligibility Form from the Requesting Without Going Through the 
School webpage.
5Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
Before Test Day  Fee Waiver Benefits for Income-Eligible Students
  Once approved for accommodations, with some exceptions, you remain approved and do 
not have to apply again when taking another College Board test.
  If you move to a new school after you’ve been approved for accommodations, provide 
them with your SSD number.
  If you’re approved for extended time for math, you’ll get it just for math; but if you’re 
approved for extended time for reading, you’ll get it for the whole test.
  Talk to your SSD coordinator to confirm what accommodations you’re approved for and 
any additional information you need for testing.
  If you are approved for text-to-speech (embedded in Bluebook, with no configuration 
needed) or screen reader (non-embedded), be sure to practice with your accommodation 
ahead of test day to ensure you understand how it will work with the digital test. 
Accommodations and Digital Testing
Most students, including students with accommodations, test digitally, with many 
accommodations provided in Bluebook. For example, if you’re approved for extended time, 
you’ll receive a digital exam enabled with your approved amount of extended time per 
section. If you need large print, you can use zoom. If you need assistance with reading, you 
might be approved for Text-to-Speech (Embedded) or Screen Reader (Non-Embedded).
Some students approved for accommodations test with the standard format and testing 
timing. Examples of these types of accommodations include permission for small-group 
testing, food/drink/medication, and permission to test blood sugar.
The SAT is accessible to students approved to use assistive technology, including a 
screen reader and text-to-speech. If you are approved for text-to-speech, you’ll use the 
tool built into Bluebook. No setup is needed. If you are approved for a screen reader, 
you’ll use your own assistive technology software or the software that is part of the 
operating system on your testing device. For screen readers or other assistive technology, 
you’ll need to open and start the assistive technology device or software before you 
open Bluebook for practice and for testing. On test day, adjust any necessary settings 
before you start to check in for the digital test. Visit our Accommodations and Assistive 
Technology webpage for detailed information about using assistive technology with 
Bluebook. Additionally, the app has extensive content to answer your questions about 
setup, navigation, and tools to help you access test content.
IMPORTANT: If you have an accommodation for extended time, once the standard time 
has elapsed for a module, you can move on when you’re ready rather than having to 
wait until your approved time is up. We encourage you to use your full allotted time 
and you should only move ahead if you have completed the module. As always, at the 
end of the test, wait until testing staff have confirmed that your test has been submitted 
before closing the lid to your laptop, turning off your tablet screen, closing Bluebook, or 
shutting down your device. Please visit SSD Updates for more information.
Fee Waiver Benefits for 
Income-Eligible Students
Students who face financial barriers to taking the SAT may be eligible for College Board 
fee waivers. Visit sat.org/feewaivers to learn whether you're eligible and how to confirm 
that with College Board. College Board offers fee waivers to any eligible students in the 
U.S. or U.S. territories. Students attending school outside the country must also be U.S. 
citizens to be eligible for fee waivers.
For each qualifying student, one fee waiver unlocks a suite of benefits, which includes 
two free registrations for the SAT administrations and unlimited score sends to colleges, 
universities, and scholarship programs. Also, seniors with fee waiver benefits will 
automatically receive waived application fees at participating colleges and universities. 
Additional Guidance
It is very helpful to practice 
taking a digital test with 
the technology you plan 
to use to test. Please

SAT fee waivers also give first-time U.S. college and university applicants fee waivers 
for applying for nonfederal financial aid using CSS Profile
®
. Learn more about this at 
profileonline.collegeboard.org.
You can learn about how to get fee waiver benefits, eligibility, and the other benefits 
offered to help you in the college application process at sat.org/feewaivers.
If you think you're eligible, talk to your school counselor about getting a fee waiver 
code. You can also request a fee waiver directly from College Board through your 
College Board account. If you request a fee waiver from College Board, please confirm 
your eligibility and then aim to submit your request as early as possible and at least 
1–2 weeks before the registration deadline. Your fee waiver status may be shared with 
your school and district.
IMPORTANT: Don’t forget the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA
®
)—the 
form you’ll need to qualify for most financial aid opportunities—can be filed beginning 
July 1. You should complete your FAFSA as early as possible.
If You Need to Borrow a Device
Students who do not have access to a device can request to borrow one from 
College Board. You may qualify to borrow a testing device if you submit a request at least 
30 days before the test date. If so, additional rules relating to borrowing a testing device 
will apply to you as shown in the terms of the Testing Device Lending Agreement.
We may be able to loan a testing device for use on test day, based on availability. This 
device would be free of charge. You’ll pick up the loaned testing device at the test center 
before the SAT and return it to testing staff in the same condition as you received it as 
soon as you complete the test and your answers are submitted. You can’t take the device 
off the test site or use it for any other purpose than to take the SAT.
Submitting a request does not guarantee that College Board will loan you a testing 
device. Test centers cannot provide you with a testing device from College Board on 
test day unless your request made for that test date was approved by College Board. If 
you show up on test day without a device, and you have not gone through the process 
of requesting and being approved to borrow one from us, you’ll be dismissed. If you are 
approved to borrow a testing device, we will make all reasonable efforts to provide you 
with such a device on test day. However, we cannot guarantee that a testing device will 
be available on test day.
If you borrow a testing device, you agree to comply with the terms of the Testing Device 
Lending Agreement in addition to the SAT Testing Rules on page 22. You’ll need to 
complete exam setup before checking in to your testing room.
Optional Questions to Answer 
When You Register
When you register for the SAT, you’ll have the opportunity to answer questions about 
yourself, your educational experience, and your plans for after you graduate high school.
Your responses give your school counselors and college admissions officers, as 
applicable, information they can use to help you plan your future. These questions are 
completely optional, and you don’t have to answer them, but the more information you 
provide, the more they can help you. However, if your parent or guardian has told you 
that you shouldn’t provide any optional or voluntary information, you shouldn’t do so.
Your answers will be used by College Board as described in its Privacy Statement at 
privacy.collegeboard.org/privacy-statement, such as for educational research and will 
be provided to your school, district, and state department of education.
7Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
Before Test Day  Useful Resources
If you choose to participate in Student Search Service™, your answers will be 
provided to participating certain education organizations, as described under 
Student Search Service below. Your answers may also be provided to colleges, 
universities, and scholarship programs to which you choose to send your scores. See 
Section 5. Privacy on page 26 of the SAT Testing Rules.
Your responses, when combined with those of all other students taking the SAT, 
contribute to an understanding of the academic preparation, extra- and cocurricular 
involvement, and post-high-school plans of your graduating class, which can help 
College Board, colleges, and universities deliver programs and opportunities to serve you 
and your classmates.

Student Search Service
Student Search Service is a free, voluntary program that connects students with 
information about opportunities from nearly 1,200 eligible colleges, universities, 
scholarships, and government agencies running education programs. By joining 
Student Search Service, you can connect with colleges and scholarship programs looking 
for students like you and discover opportunities you had not previously considered.
Key facts about Student Search Service:
  You can join for free and hear from a diverse group of nonprofit accredited colleges 
and universities (domestic and international), nonprofit scholarship providers, and 
government agencies administering educational programs (“Education Organizations”). 
No other organizations or companies are eligible to participate in Student Search Service.
  When you take a College Board test, you’ll be asked to provide certain information about 
yourself by answering optional questions about yourself during registration.
  You’ll have the opportunity to join Student Search Service as part of registration. It’s 
entirely up to you whether to opt in. The service is free to you, but Education Organizations 
may pay us a licensing fee to use the service. We use those fees to support our nonprofit, 
mission-driven work, including providing fee waivers so that students from lower income 
families can take the SAT for free. College Board is a nonprofit organization.
  Being part of Student Search Service is voluntary and you can opt out at any time.
  Being contacted by an Education Organization doesn't mean you've been admitted or 
received a scholarship. You must submit the required information and complete steps 
requested by the Education Organization for potential admission, enrollment, scholarship 
and/or financial aid.
How Student Search Service Works
  If you opt in, you may be identified by Education Organizations as a potential match for 
their programs and opportunities.
  Education Organizations generally look for groups of students based on expected 
graduation date, where they live, self-reported cumulative grade point average (GPA), 
test score ranges, intended college major, geography, and other limited parameters. This 
information may be provided by you to College Board, such as during test registration, 
testing, and when using the College Board college planning website, BigFuture.org.
  College Board never shares your actual test scores, grades, disability status, parent 
information (unless they separately opt in to Student Search Service), or telephone 
numbers. Please note, we do share test score ranges and GPA. For details on the 
information shared, please see bigfuture.collegeboard.org/student-search-service/
what-information-shared. If you opt in to Student Search Service, we may share 
information that you provided prior to and after opting in to Student Search Service, but 
we will not share any information until you opt in.
8Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
Before Test Day  Privacy Policies
  If you have opted in and match the Education Organizations’ search criteria, we will 
provide them with your contact information so they can reach out to you by postal mail 
(if you provided your address) and/or email about their programs and opportunities. They 
have to keep your data secure and may not share your data with any third parties (other 
than service providers to the Education Organizations).
Education Organizations send students information about things like:
  Financial aid, scholarships, or other ways to make college or university more affordable
  Details on campus life and student services
  Overviews of majors, courses, and degree options
  Deadline information
  Offers of direct admissions to a college

Organizations that have already received your name and other data may continue to 
send you information. You may contact such organizations directly to opt out of further 
communications from them.
Connect to Opportunities in Higher Education
Each year millions of students take the SAT, and thousands of high school counselors 
and postsecondary admissions officers worldwide use their scores to guide decisions in 
the college application process. The test that you’ll take on test day is a challenging and 
fair assessment of what you know and can do. The questions you’ll tackle focus on the 
knowledge and skills that the best available evidence indicates are essential for college 
and career readiness and success.
We’re committed to providing opportunities to help you reach your goals for college and 
career. Students who are the first in their families to consider attending college, who 
come from low-income families, or whose ethnicities are historically excluded in colleges 
may feel that college isn’t for them. Our mission is to help all students recognize and 
make the most of the opportunities they’ve earned.
Privacy Policies
College Board recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy. Please review our 
privacy policies at collegeboard.org/privacy-center (“Privacy Policies”) and the SAT 
Testing Rules on page 22 to understand our collection, use, and disclosure of your 
personally identifiable information
Telemarketing Scams
We sometimes get reports of phone scams when callers posing as employees of 
College Board try to sell test preparation products or request sensitive, personally 
identifying information, such as credit card and Social Security numbers. College Board 
does not make unsolicited phone calls or send emails to students or families requesting 
this type of information. This type of activity, known as telemarketing fraud, is a crime 
and should be reported to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Please visit 
Important Information About Telemarketing and Internet Scams for more information.

Before Test Day Test Question Inquiries
Test Question Inquiries
If you find what you consider to be an error or an ambiguity in a test question, tell the 
test coordinator immediately after the test. You may also complete an online form to 
report a test error or ambiguity available at satsuite.collegeboard.org/contact-us.
In your inquiry, provide your name and email address, the date you took the SAT, the 
name and address of the school where you took the test, the test section and module, the 
test question (as well as you can remember), and an explanation of your concern about 
the question.
College Board will send you a response after your inquiry has been reviewed thoroughly 
by subject-matter specialists. If you submit a report for what you consider to be an error 
or an ambiguity in a test question, you understand that College Board may need to hold 
your SAT score for review. As a result, your score may not be available by the published 
release date for your administration.
Makeup Testing
During bad weather, natural disasters, power outages, or other unusual conditions, test 
centers may be closed. Check sat.org/test-center-closings for test center closings on 
Friday night and Saturday morning before you go to the test center. Information about 
makeup testing is posted as it’s available. If a makeup date has been confirmed, that 
information is included.
The following policies apply to makeup testing:
  The availability of makeup testing and the conditions that make test takers eligible 
to take a makeup test are at the sole discretion of College Board. The ability to offer a 
makeup test is based on test center availability.
  Test centers may close or make changes on short notice, including on test day, and they 
may even close for the scheduled makeup date.
  Access to scores from makeup administrations may be delayed by several weeks.
Additional Information for Students
A primary purpose of the SAT is to predict how prepared students are to succeed, both 
in college and in career training programs. College Board continues to conduct extensive 
research on the predictive validity of the SAT. Several recent validity studies examined digital 
SAT score relationships with other education measures such as high school GPA (HSGPA) 
and the relationship of SAT scores to university outcomes. These studies found that:
  SAT scores are strongly predictive of college performance, and this finding also holds for 
historically excluded minority students, first-generation college students, and students 
whose best language was another language or English and another language.
  SAT scores meaningfully improve the prediction of college performance above HSGPA alone.
  Institutions using SAT scores can have confidence these scores will provide valuable 
insights for understanding students’ readiness for college, course placement and major-
field decisions, scholarship and honors program decisions, and identifying students who 
may need academic support.
SAT scores provide meaningful information about a student’s likelihood of success in 
college and university, but the SAT should not be used as the sole source of information 
for high-stakes decisions. Find out more at sat.org.

Before Test Day Additional Information for Students
Download a copy of the Assessment Framework for the Digital SAT Suite to learn 
more about the evidence-based design and development of the digital SAT Suite. A 
large-scale, national study evaluating the validity of digital SAT scores to predict college 
outcomes will be conducted once College Board has sufficient data from operational 
administrations of the test to support such analyses.
Procedures to Ensure Fairness and Equity
College Board combats any bias in our tests with our review processes. Fairness 
reviewers help ensure that test materials are accessible to all students, have no offensive 
or insensitive content, and aren’t made easier or harder by factors outside the subject 
being measured.
Relationship of SAT Scores to Family Income
College Board no longer collects information regarding family income from test takers. Past 
data indicate that students from every income level obtain a full range of SAT scores.

Prepare for the SAT Test Preview
Prepare for the SAT
College Board offers many free, official ways to help you prepare for the SAT at 
sat.org/practice. Here are some of them:
Test Preview
To prepare for the SAT, you’ll have access to a test preview within Bluebook. This tool 
helps you:
  Get familiar with functions in the app.
  See the structure of the test.
  Try a small sample of reading and writing and math questions to familiarize yourself 
with the kinds of questions you’ll encounter on test day and with how to properly enter 
your answers.
  Try all the testing tools and experience how the digital tests work with any assistive 
technology you’re approved to use.
Full-Length Adaptive SAT Practice Tests
Taking a full-length practice test for the SAT will let you experience digital testing and 
familiarize yourself with test content, including the types of questions you’ll answer and 
the exam tools you’ll use to take the test. If you’ll be using a personal device for testing, 
you can also make sure your device supports the app and is ready to use on test day.
Both sections on the SAT, (1) Reading and Writing and (2) Math, have 2 modules. 
Depending on how you answer the questions in the first module, you’ll be routed to a 
second module, which has a different mix of difficulty levels. The mix of questions in the 
second module is, on average, either of higher difficulty or of lower difficulty than the 
mix in the first module. Taking a practice test in Bluebook helps you gain experience and 
comfort with the way you’ll be assessed on test day.
The full-length practice tests will also give you a score.
1. Download the Bluebook app at bluebook.collegeboard.org.
2. Go to Practice and Prepare on the Bluebook homepage and select 
Full-Length Practice.
3. After you’ve finished the practice test in Bluebook, go to My Practice at 
mypractice.collegeboard.org to view your score results and to review 
your practice exam questions and their skill level, as well as the answers, 
and explanations.

Prepare for the SAT Student Question Bank
Student Question Bank
You can use the Student Question Bank to design your own practice. The question 
bank has thousands of official practice questions and you can filter by assessment, 
section (Reading and Writing or Math), domain, skill, and difficulty level. You can go to 
My Practice to access the Student Question Bank.
Additional Practice
You can also try targeted practice questions in My Practice. If you click the Practice 
Specific Questions link, My Practice gathers a tailored set of questions from our Student 
Question Bank based on your performance on a practice test. These questions are 
specifically designed to help you build your skills at a level that’s right for you.
Question of the Day
The Question of the Day web app is a fun and fast way to check your knowledge. Each 
day, you can choose to answer a Reading and Writing question or a Math question. The 
content comes from the makers of the SAT Suite of Assessments, so you can answer 
official questions in a casual setting, earn badges, and build your streak. For more 
information, visit qotd.collegeboard.org.
Paper-Based Practice Tests
College Board provides downloadable paper versions of practice tests for those students 
who need to test with paper-based accommodations on test day. Since the PDF versions 
of our practice tests are nonadaptive, they're recommended only for students who will 
test with paper-based accommodations on test day.
While taking practice tests in Bluebook, every student is welcome to toggle on and 
experiment with certain built-in accommodations (text-to-speech, screen readers, 
etc.). However, practicing with accommodations does NOT mean you are approved 
to take an actual assessment with those accommodations. If you need to test with 
accommodations, please ask your school's SSD coordinator to submit a request through 
SSD Online at least 7 weeks before test day. For more information, visit How to Request 
Accommodations.
The Official SAT Study Guide
For additional tips on using practice tests effectively, check out an updated version of 
The Official SAT Study Guide from the College Board bookstore or wherever you find 
test prep materials. You can also purchase the study guide when you register to take the 
SAT. While you can take practice tests for free in Bluebook, taking a printed practice test 
in the study guide is another strategy to help you build your endurance and strengthen 
your understanding of the questions on the test.
What the Reading and 
Writing Section Is Like
The Reading and Writing section of the SAT is designed to measure your success with 
building critical college and career readiness in literacy. In this section, you’ll answer 
multiple-choice questions requiring you to read, comprehend, and use information and 
ideas in texts; analyze the craft and structure of texts; revise texts to improve the rhetorical 
expression of ideas; and edit texts to follow core conventions of Standard English.
Passages in this section, which serve as the basis for answering test questions, represent 
the subject areas of literature, history/social studies, the humanities, and science. There 
is a single question per passage.

Information You’ll Need on 
Test Day for Digital Testing
Be prepared for digital testing by making sure you bring only what you need for the test. 
Leave all prohibited items at home. You’ll have your testing device, but won’t be able to 
use or access any other personal electronic devices, such as a mobile phone or wearable 
technology, during the test. Review the other important guidelines in this section to make 
sure you understand the policies that cover your SAT testing experience.
This section also includes information about test day technical support.
Test Day Items
See Section 1 of the SAT Testing Rules on page 22 for full requirements for taking the SAT.
The following items are required for taking the SAT:
  A valid photo ID for check-in. See sat.org/id.
  Your admission ticket. Show your printed ticket or present it on your mobile device.
  Your College Board username (your email address) and password.
  A fully charged, acceptable testing device with Bluebook already downloaded and exam 
setup complete.
  A pen or pencil for scratch work.
Though not required, consider bringing:
  Snacks and drinks (which must be under your desk during testing).

to using the embedded Desmos calculator in Bluebook). Please see sat.org/calculator 
for more information.
  Extra batteries, a power cord, and backup calculator.
  Backup testing device.
Test Day Steps
This section summarizes important guidelines for digital testing. See Section 1.  Taking 
the SAT  on page 22 to make sure you cover all the steps to successfully prepare to take 
the SAT.
  Plan ahead and bring equipment that’s in good working order with enough battery 
power to last for about 3 hours. Your testing device must be able to connect to new Wi-Fi 
networks, and you may need to update your operating system to support the digital test.
  Arrive early if you were approved to borrow a device to complete exam setup and obtain 
your admission ticket. You must bring confirmation of approval.
  If you’re testing with extended time, bring a power cord; your testing site should provide 
an outlet for recharging if needed.
  Download the Bluebook app onto the device you'll use on test day from 
bluebook.app.collegeboard.org.
  Between 1 and 5 days before the test, you need to sign in to the app, agree to the Privacy 
Policy and Use of This App rules and complete exam setup. You’ll get access to your 
admission ticket once you’ve completed exam setup.
  On test day, at the center, you’ll follow instructions to connect to Wi-Fi, complete exam 
check-in on your testing device, and type a brief statement saying that you agree to 
follow all rules for the exam.
Reminder
If you’re using a loaned 
device from College Board, 
arrive 30 minutes early so 
you have time to complete 
exam setup and access your 
admission ticket.
17Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
Information You’ll Need on Test Day for Digital Testing  Support on Test Day
  During testing:
  Head coverings worn for medical or religious reasons are permitted during testing as 
long as they don’t obstruct testing staffs' ability to view your eyes and ears. You’re 
not permitted to wear other head coverings while testing; if you are wearing one, 
store it under your desk. If you’re wearing a hooded shirt in the testing room, your 
hood must stay down during testing.
  Store any snacks or drinks you bring under your desk. You may only eat snacks 
during breaks. The testing staff will tell you where you can go to have your snack.
  You must remain in the testing site for the duration of the test. If you leave before 
you’re dismissed, your scores are subject to cancellation.
  Keep your laptop open or your tablet uncovered and on during the entire duration of 
testing. Closing your laptop lid or covering your device may result in a loss of your 
responses.
  Bluebook will tell you when to take your break. Because the test is individually timed, 
you’ll break and finish testing at slightly different times from other students in your 
room. It’s important to maintain a silent testing environment regardless.
  Keep your photo ID with you at all times, especially if you leave the testing room. You 
may be asked to show your ID at any time while in the test center.
Support on Test Day
Bluebook is designed for minimal network and device requirements. You need an internet 
connection to start the test and at the end of testing to submit your answers. If you lose 
connectivity while you’re testing, you can keep going without losing any work.
IMPORTANT: When using Bluebook as intended, with no other programs or applications 
running, the draw on your device’s battery will be fairly low. You’re allowed to have a 
power cord with you, but most students can take the entire test without ever plugging in 
their devices.
Before, during, and after testing, there is a Help icon in the Bluebook app where users 
can review troubleshooting tips.
Your test center will provide additional support on test day. They will help ensure the 
test center Wi-Fi network is working and assist you if you encounter connectivity issues. 
Additionally, there will be a help room for you to troubleshoot device issues with the 
testing staff, although most of the time students are able to resolve issues on their own 
by restarting the application. If you encounter a technical issue on test day, you won't 
lose any testing time. We’ll also have customer service resources ready to help the test 
center troubleshoot issues on test day.
Reminder
The deadline to submit 
answers, if unsuccessful on 
test day, is 11:59 p.m. local 
time the next day. Students 
using a loaned device should 
not leave the test center 
until their answers are 
submitted.

Information You’ll Need on Test Day for Digital Testing  Digital Testing Recap
Digital Testing Recap
  Before arriving to the test center you’ll need to complete exam setup in Bluebook to 
generate your admission ticket. You will be turned away if you’re unprepared.
  Your admission ticket is needed to check in to the test center. Your testing device should 
be fully charged and able to last the duration of the test and exam setup. You can bring a 
charger, but we can’t guarantee access to an outlet unless you have an accommodation 
for extended time.
  You’ll break and finish testing at slightly different times from other students in your 
room. Bluebook tells you when to take your break instead of the proctor.
  Test centers have a help room to assist with simple troubleshooting; however, most 
students are able to solve any issues on their own with a simple app restart.
  If you run into a technical issue, you won’t lose testing time. You’ll need access to 
the internet to start the test and submit answers but you can continue testing if the 
connection is disrupted during the test.
  Student devices are locked during testing and you won’t be able to access other 
applications on your device. Bluebook is the only application you can have open on your 
device during testing unless approved for external assistive technology.

After the Test  How the SAT Is Scored
After the Test
Once you’ve taken the SAT, the next step is to access your scores, understand what they 
mean, and track your progress. Use the information in this section to help you make the 
most of your scores. You can also explore additional College Board tools to help you plan 
for the future.
How the SAT Is Scored
The SAT Suite uses a multistage adaptive test design and item response theory (IRT) 
methodology to precisely measure students’ knowledge and skills with fewer questions 
in less time. Every test includes a standardized set of question types and measures 
the same content domains, so all students have equitable opportunity to demonstrate 
their strengths. Your scores depend on several factors, including whether you answer 
questions right or wrong, the difficulty level of the questions, and the probability that you 
might be guessing. For most students, it is better to guess than leave a question blank, 
especially if you can eliminate one or two wrong answers first. To learn more about how 
assessments in the SAT Suite adapt to your performance, watch our What is Digital SAT 
Adaptive Testing? video.

Getting Your Scores
Your online scores give you the meaning behind your numbers by providing a summary 
of how you did on each section. You can access your online scores through your 
College Board account. If you can’t access your scores online, your school can print a 
score report PDF for you. Visit sat.org/scores for more information.
Your College Board student account at studentscores.collegeboard.org provides you 
additional insights about your scores and information about BigFuture. The online score 
insights include:
  Percentiles that let you see how your results compare with those of other students like you.
  Additional information about knowledge and skills, including how you scored on every 
content domain on the test, so you can identify your strengths and areas for growth.
  A search tool for careers and college majors, with suggestions based on information you 
provide in your profile.
Explore Career Options
For students in the U.S., your score report will show Career Insights Snapshot—a 
list of growing careers in your state that connects you to your math and reading and 
writing skills based on your SAT Suite performance. Career Insights Snapshot provides 
career examples, not recommendations, that can stimulate your thinking, broaden your 
awareness of career options, and encourage deeper career exploration beyond the score

Sending Scores  Score Reporting
Sending Scores
You’ll also have the opportunity when you register for the SAT to choose up to 4 colleges, 
universities, or scholarship programs to receive your scores for free. You can designate 
your score recipients (i) at the time you register, (ii) any time until you test, or (iii) within 
9 days after you test. For these free score sends, only your scores from the test date on 
the registration will be sent (or the makeup test for that registration if you take a makeup 
test), unless you specifically ask to send more existing SAT scores. (Sending scores to 
additional colleges, universities, or scholarship programs can be requested online for a 
fee.) We share with your school and district the names of the organizations you select for 
your 4 free score sends.
If you want to change where your scores are sent, you have until 9 days after the test date 
to alter your 4 free score reports at no charge. After that, you can’t make any changes and 
you’ll need to place a new order. You’ll be charged the additional score report request 
fee for each institution you send scores to, although you can send multiple scores to 
the same institution for one fee. Score Choice™ lets you choose which scores are sent. 
Visit sendsatscores.collegeboard.org/login for more information.
The scores you receive and the score reports received by colleges and your high school 
contain total and section scores. Section scores are converted to a point scale from 
200 to 800; these are added together to create a total score between 400 and 1600. (See How 
the SAT Is Scored on page 19 for more information.) Additional score sends include all 
your available scores unless you choose otherwise, as explained later in this section.
College Board doesn’t use your raw score or your reported scaled score by itself or in 
combination with any other information to predict your individual future academic 
performance at specific postsecondary institutions. However, College Board does help 
individual colleges and universities use and interpret SAT scores.
When you request that we send your scores to the colleges, universities, or scholarship 
programs you choose, we send your scores, certain demographic information about 
you, and other information you provide when taking the SAT to those organizations, 
in accordance with sat.org/scores. These organizations may use this information to 
send you information about admissions, educational, financial aid, and scholarship 
opportunities. Being contacted by these organizations does not mean you have been 
admitted or are eligible for a scholarship or financial aid program. You must submit an 
application to be considered for admission at a college or university, and complete any 
steps required by any scholarship programs to be considered for their opportunities.
In certain college and university systems, once you submit your score to one school, 
other schools within that system will also have access to your score. Please note, 
however, that if you are applying to more than one school within a college or university 
system, it is still important for you to send your SAT scores to each individual school. If 
you are not sure whether the specific school you are applying to is part of such a system, 
contact the school’s admissions office.
Score Reporting
Your score and other information about you will be sent to your high school, district, 
state department of education, to certain federal and state scholarship programs, state 
direct admissions programs, and to the organizations you choose as described under 
Sending Scores above and in accordance with our Privacy Policy in Section 5. Privacy 
on page 26.
  Each time you take the SAT, the scores are added to your College Board record. All of 
your scores are reported to your high school.
21Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
Sending Scores  Score Choice
  You can send scores to additional colleges and scholarship programs online, for a fee. 
They’ll be sent to your designated colleges and scholarship programs 5-10 business days 
after the request is received. Once you place an order to send scores, the order cannot be 
canceled. Visit sendsatscores.collegeboard.org/login for more information.
  If your score is canceled, no score reports for that test date will be sent.
  If you take a makeup test, the score report(s) will include the score from the makeup test.
For additional information regarding the College Board score cancellation policy, see 
Section 4. Score Cancellation and Disciplinary Measures in the SAT Testing Rules on 
page 25. For more information about voluntarily canceling your scores, see Section 6d. 
Miscellaneous in the SAT Testing Rules.
Score Choice
If you take the SAT more than once, you can have the option of Score Choice, if you 
choose to send scores online for a fee. With Score Choice, you can choose which scores 
you send to colleges. Choose by test date for the SAT—but keep in mind that some 
colleges and scholarship programs require you to send all your scores.
This online service is optional and only applies to scores already received. It is 
not applicable to any of your 4 free score sends you may select; those scores are 
automatically included in those score reports. If you don’t use Score Choice, we’ll send 
all your SAT scores from your most recent 6 administrations. However, if you want 
only your highest scores to be seen from already released scores, select Score Choice. 
Each school or program has its own deadlines and policies for how scores are used. 
Information is listed on the score-sending site for each participating organization, but 
check with the individual school or scholarship program to make sure you’re following its 
guidelines. We’re not responsible for the accuracy of the information or the consequences 
of your decisions.
Keeping Scores on File
Your test scores and related personal information that you provide to College Board 
become part of your student record and are retained in accordance with our Privacy 
Statement. For requests to have a permanent College Board student record removed, 
individuals must call College Board Customer Service, write to College Board, (Attention: 
Customer Service), or email DataProtectionInquiry@collegeboard.org. See the inside 
front cover of this guide for contact information.

SAT Testing Rules
Introduction
This is a legal contract between you and College Board.
WARNING: There are serious consequences for not following the rules. You may be dismissed 
from the test. Your test may not be scored, or your scores may be canceled. You may be 
banned from taking future College Board tests. Your conduct may be reported to your high 
school and colleges to which you apply.
NOTE: See Section 9 for how disagreements between you and College Board will be handled.
Section 1.  
Taking the SAT 
  The SAT
®
 is a digital test. You will take the SAT on a testing device, using an app 
called Bluebook™.
  You must provide an acceptable photo when you register for the SAT in accordance with 
sat.org/photo. You may make changes to your photo up to 5 days before you test. The photo 
you provide during registration will be used to identify you on test day.
  Your testing device must be one of the following:
  Windows laptop,
  Mac laptop,
  Windows tablet (external keyboard is required with a Windows tablet), or other tablet,
  iPad,
  Chromebook managed by your school.
  In some cases, you may be able to take the SAT on a desktop computer in a school 
computer lab.
  You cannot use any other devices to take the SAT. You cannot take the SAT on a mobile phone.
  You may qualify to borrow a testing device from College Board if you submit a request with 
your test registration before the deadline. See below in the Miscellaneous section for more 
information on borrowing a testing device. A testing device that is loaned to you by College 
Board will have Bluebook already installed.
  Your testing device must have enough charge to last the duration of the exam and setup.
  Make sure your device is running on an approved operating system.  
See bluebook.collegeboard.org/students/approved-devices for more information.
  Bluebook must be downloaded to your testing device before you can take the SAT. If your 
testing device is managed by your school, your school may download Bluebook for you. It is 
your responsibility to check if your school did so. If you are using your own testing device, you 
will need to download Bluebook yourself. You can download Bluebook from the College Board 
website at bluebook.app.collegeboard.org.
  You must sign in to Bluebook using your College Board online account username (email 
address) and password, sign the “Privacy Policy and Use of This App” rules, and complete 
exam setup before the test. Bluebook will generate your admission ticket once you have 
completed exam setup.
23Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
SAT Testing Rules 
  You must bring your electronic or printed admission ticket to the SAT. You’ll show this to the 
proctor when you check in. If you are using a testing device loaned to you by College Board, 
your ticket will be generated on test day after you complete exam setup.
  If we determine that there is a difference between your photo ID and your admission ticket, or 
if the photo ID doesn’t meet our requirements (for example, if your preferred name is on one 
field but your full name is on another), we may, in our sole discretion, deny you admission to 
the test site. We may also dismiss you from the test site, decline to score your test, or cancel 
your test scores.
  Staff at your test site will direct you to your testing room.
  You will connect to your testing site’s internet.
  You MAY bring the following to the test:
  A power cord and/or a portable charger. There is no guarantee that you will have access 
to an outlet for charging.
  An external mouse and mouse pad.
  A calculator that meets the requirements located at satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/
what-to-bring-do/calculator-policy. Before testing, you will be asked to clear all saved 
formulas on a calculator you bring. There is also a calculator in Bluebook that you can 
use instead of bringing your own if you wish. Either way, you can use a calculator for the 
entire Math section.
  Pen or pencil for scratch work. This pencil does not have to be a No. 2 pencil. Proctors 
will give you paper before the test begins.
  Close all applications other than Bluebook before the test begins. You are not allowed to have 
any other apps open on your testing device during testing. You are not allowed to paste work 
into Bluebook from another program or application. Certain testing accommodations may 
allow for exceptions to this rule.
  An internet connection is required to start the test and to submit your answers at the end 
of the test. You will receive instructions from your proctor on test day if there is an internet 
outage.
  There are 2 sections of the SAT. The first section is Reading and Writing, and the second 
section is Math. Each section of the SAT has 2 modules (parts). Once you leave a module, you 
cannot return to it.
  Bluebook has a timer that will count down the minutes and seconds remaining in each 
module. You can hide the timer until the last 5 minutes of the module.
  You must stay for the full length of the standard time test. You cannot submit your answers 
before the standard timer runs out.
  Enter all your answers into Bluebook.
  Do not close the lid or cover the screen of your testing device until your answers are 
submitted. Doing so may prevent your answers from being submitted.
  If your answers were successfully submitted, you will see a confirmation screen. If your 
testing device is not connected to the internet when the SAT ends and your answers are not 
submitted, you have until 11:59 p.m. local time the next day to reconnect to the internet and 
submit your answers.
  Generally, College Board will score all tests that have been started. If your answers are not 
complete, your scores may be used only for guidance purposes. In this case, scores may be 
reported to you, your school, your district, or your state, but will not be reportable to colleges 
and scholarship institutions.
  Some students may be approved to take the SAT using a paper test as a testing 
accommodation. In this case, students will select their answers in the test book. Students 
must select only 1 answer for each question. If the student selects more than 1 answer, the 
answer will be marked as wrong. Answers will be entered manually into Bluebook by testing 
staff or by College Board.

Section 4. 
Score Cancellation
a. Score Cancellation and Disciplinary Measures. If College Board determines that your scores 
are invalid under Section 4(b) below, or you have committed Misconduct under Section 4(c) 
below, we may, in our sole discretion, take 1 or more of the following measures (“Measures”): 
deny you entry to a test, dismiss you from the test, not score your test, cancel your scores, prevent 
you from taking future College Board tests (including the SAT, Advanced Placement
®
 (AP
®
) and 
CLEP
®
 Exams), and/or share information with others as described in Section 4(f) below.
CAUTION! THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHEATING ON THE SAT ARE SEVERE.
b. Invalid Scores. We may cancel your scores and/or take any of the other Measures described 
above if after following the procedures set forth in this section, we determine, in our sole 
discretion, that there is substantial evidence that your scores are invalid (“Invalid Scores”). 
Examples of evidence of Invalid Scores include, without limitation, unusual answer patterns 
or other evidence that indicates these rules have been violated. Before canceling your scores 
under this Invalid Scores section, we will notify you in writing (via email if an email address 
is provided by you in Bluebook for this test) or through your test site. We will then offer you 3 
choices: voluntary score cancellation, a free retest under closely monitored conditions (during 
the next 2 available administrations after such review), or an opportunity to give us additional 
information and request a further review by a College Board panel. If you choose a further 
review by a College Board panel, and it confirms, in its sole discretion, that your scores are 
invalid, we will offer you 3 choices: voluntary score cancellation, a free retest under closely 
monitored conditions (during the next 2 available administrations after such review), or binding 
arbitration (or small claims court) as described below. If you choose the retest option, you 
may not review scores from the test under review—such scores will be canceled. The process 
described in this Section 4(b) is called the “Score Validity Process.” Additional information 
about security measures and consequences of violating security policies is located at 
satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/test-security-fairness. The binding arbitration (or small claims 
court) option is available only for tests administered in the United States and U.S. territories.
c. Misconduct. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that there is overwhelming evidence 
that you did not follow these rules (“Misconduct”), the Score Validity Process will not be 
offered to you. Instead, we may cancel your scores and/or take any of the Measures described 
above. Examples of Misconduct are doing or attempting to do the following: using an answer 
key, mobile phone, the internet, or an application other than Bluebook; removing the test or 
answers; disrupting the College Board server or Bluebook through a cyberattack or other 
activity; duplicating the test or Bluebook; or altering the test, answer keys, or any data after 
testing was complete. Misconduct may be shown in many ways. For example, Misconduct may 
be shown through observations during the test or by evidence discovered after the test.
d. Testing Irregularities. We may cancel your scores if we determine that any testing 
irregularity occurred (collectively “Testing Irregularities”). Examples of Testing Irregularities 
include problems with the test, irregular circumstances, or events associated with a test 
that may affect 1 or more test takers. Examples of this are errors like improper seating, 
improperly admitting someone to the test, giving an accommodation that is not approved 
by College Board, defective materials, defective equipment, technical issues like a Bluebook 
malfunction, testing device malfunction, hardware issues, or an internet outage. These also 
include evidence of possible preknowledge of the test, and disruptions of the test caused 
by internet disruptions, natural disasters, weather events, epidemics or pandemics, wars, 
riots, civil disturbances, or other emergencies. When Testing Irregularities occur, we may 
cancel an entire administration or individual registrations, decline to score all or part of the 
test, or cancel scores. We may do this regardless of whether or not you caused the Testing
26Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
SAT Testing Rules 
Irregularities, benefited from them, or violated these rules. We may, in our sole discretion, give 
you the opportunity to take the test again within a reasonable time frame, and without charge. 
This is the only fix that may be available to you as a result of Testing Irregularities.
e. Test Taker Reporting Violations or Suspicious Behavior. You may confidentially 
report any suspected violation of these rules, or any suspicion concerning the 
security of any College Board test, by immediately reporting this information to 
College Board online at forms.collegeboard.org/reportcheating or by emailing us at 
collegeboardtestsecurity@collegeboard.org.
f. College Board Sharing Information with Others. We may share the results of test security 
investigations (including without limitation those relating to Misconduct and Invalid Scores 
described above, and other disciplinary-related information), with others outside of College 
Board. This includes your school, any score recipient, college, higher education institution 
or agency, scholarship organization, potential score recipient, government agency in the 
United States or abroad, parents, legal guardians, or law enforcement. College Board may also 
share such information with others that have a good reason for knowing the information or 
who may be able to help College Board in its investigation or who may be conducting their 
own investigation. College Board may answer questions from any institution to which you 
submitted a score. If you make public any review, investigation, or decision of College Board, 
College Board may make public any and all details of such matter.
Section 5. 
Privacy
a. Privacy Policies. College Board recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy. Our 
privacy policies are located at collegeboard.org/privacy-center (“Privacy Policies”), and also 
available to you under Help on the Bluebook homepage. Privacy Policies are part of these rules. 
You consent to the collection, use, and disclosure by College Board of your information, including 
personally identifiable information, described in the Privacy Policies and in these rules. College 
Board may update its Privacy Policies from time to time, and they are subject to change up to

Protocol (IP) address, screen size and resolution, number of screens, available memory, 
storage and disk bytes, disk mount, type and size, battery level, and other device-specific 
information for the purposes described below.
Activity Data: We also capture and monitor the actions you take in Bluebook, including your 
responses, where you click, where you put your mouse on the page, how long you spend on 
each page, ctrl/alt/delete attempts, and how you navigate through Bluebook.
Testing Device Data and Activity Data: Your testing device Data and Activity Data (collectively, 
“Data”) may be used by College Board to make sure your testing device is compatible with 
Bluebook, for test security purposes, for test validation and research, and to develop and 
improve College Board products and services. Data may be disclosed to trusted vendors, but 
only when they are providing services to College Board, and we may disclose aggregated data 
(combined data of test takers that does not identify you) and de-identified data (data that does 
not have information to identify you). Data is not sold or licensed to third parties, including 
without limitation for their marketing purposes or other commercial purposes. We may share 
Data with your school, district or state education department related to the SAT you take on 
Bluebook, including any misuse of Bluebook. You will also be asked to type specific sentences

educational and informational messages about the topics listed above.
  Being contacted by Education Organizations doesn’t mean you have been admitted 
or received a scholarship. You must submit required information and complete steps 
requested by the Education Organization(s) for potential admission, enrollment, 
scholarships, and/or financial aid. College Board is not involved in any of the selection or 
decision making by the Education Organizations.
  Education Organizations may pay a license fee to College Board to license (use) your 
information. College Board uses these license fees to help support its mission-driven 
work. Students do not pay a fee for Student Search Service.
  Education Organizations (i) may not share your information with others except to their 
contractors such as direct mail service providers, and (ii) may only keep your information 
for a limited time period.

d. Scholarship Programs. College Board automatically sends your scores and personally 
identifiable information to the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program for test takers in all states, 
the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Puerto Rico, and for U.S. citizens abroad. 
In addition, based on your mailing address or high school, this information may also be 
sent to state scholarship and recognition programs in various states, including, by way of 
example only, Alaska, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, 
and West Virginia. This information is used by such programs to consider your eligibility for 
a scholarship or recognition program. College Board is not involved in any of the selection or 
decision making for any of these scholarship programs.
  Opt-out: You can opt out by notifying College Board, in writing, no more than 15 days after 
the test date, at College Board SAT Program, Attention: Confidentiality, P.O. Box 025505, 
Miami, FL 33102 or by contacting customer service at inquiry@collegeboard.org.
e. State Direct Admissions Programs. Based on your mailing address or high school, College 
Board may automatically send your scores and personally identifiable information to state 
government agencies that are operating direct admissions programs on behalf of their state 
public higher education institutions. This information is used by such programs to facilitate 
and administer these programs, including to consider your eligibility for direct admissions 
to the participating state public higher education institutions and may be disclosed to those 
institutions. There is no guarantee of admissions, scholarships, or financial aid. Any offers of 
direct admission you receive may require you to complete additional steps as defined by the
28Fall 2025 SAT WEEKEND Student Guide  
SAT Testing Rules 
state public higher education institution(s), such as to confirm your admission and enrollment 
as well as to be considered for financial aid. The state government agency operating the direct

  We send your scores, data from your scores, other information you provide in connection with 
testing, and certain demographic information to your school and district. In addition, this 
information may be sent to your state for educational, diagnostic, and/or reporting purposes.
  When you request that we send your scores to colleges or other organizations as 
designated by you during registration and/or via your College Board account, we send 
your scores, certain demographic information, and other information you provide during 
testing to those colleges and organizations in accordance with sat.org/scores. These 
organizations may use this information to send you information about admissions, 
educational, financial aid, and scholarship opportunities. Being contacted by these 
organizations does not mean you have been admitted or are eligible for a scholarship or 
financial aid program. You must submit an application to be considered for admission at a 
college or university, and complete any steps required by any scholarship programs to be 
considered for their opportunities. We may share with your state, school, and district the 
names of the organizations you select for your free score sends available during registration.
  Connections. College Board has a separate program called Connections that is offered to 
schools and school districts and that connects students with information about nonprofit 
accredited colleges and universities (domestic and international), nonprofit scholarship 
providers, and government agencies administering educational programs, without 
disclosure of their personally identifiable information. Where available, students who take 
the PSAT/NMSQT, PSAT 10, or the SAT during the school day can opt in to Connections. 
You can’t opt in to Connections as part of this SAT Weekend test, but if you have already 
opted in to Connections or if you opt in later, your SAT Weekend score range is included 
in the information used to match you to organizations as part of Connections. More 
information about Connections is available at satsuite.org/bigfutureschool.

that College Board will provide you with a testing device. Test sites cannot provide you with 
a testing device on test day unless your request made for the test date was approved. If you 
are approved to borrow a testing device, we will make all reasonable efforts to provide you 
with such device on test day. However, we cannot guarantee that a testing device will be 
available on test day. Additional information is available on the College Board website at 
satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/device-lending.

scholarship programs you selected in your score sends unless you contact us to request 
otherwise. You must call customer service at 866-756-7346 (+1-212-713-7789 internationally)

recordings like images, video, or audio of you at your test site. Recordings are retained as long 
as reasonably necessary. College Board may disclose these recordings to law enforcement 
and/or as reasonably necessary to protect the rights and property of College Board or others.
m. Your SAT may include questions that do not count toward your score. These questions may 
show up in any of the test sections. They are being pretested for future SAT administrations. 
Testing time for the SAT takes these questions into account.
n. After the SAT, you may be asked to participate in a survey or to answer sample test questions. 
If you provide us with an email address, you may receive an invitation via email. Participation

These decisions are in the sole discretion of College Board.
t. You may submit a report to College Board if you think there is an error or something is unclear 
in a test question. If so, College Board may need to hold your SAT score for this review. Your 
score may not be available by the published release date for your test.

a. General Arbitration Rules (“General Arbitration Rules” )
All disputes between you and College Board (each a “party” ) that relate in any way to 
registering for, participating in, or taking the SAT, including but not limited to requesting or 
receiving test accommodations, score reporting, the use of your data, test security issues, or 
the Score Validity Process (defined in the “Invalid Scores” section herein), will exclusively be 
resolved in binding arbitration or small claims court. By agreeing to arbitration in accordance 
with this section, you are waiving your right to have your dispute heard by a judge or jury 
except as set forth below. Disputes relating to the Score Validity Process are subject to 
both these General Arbitration Rules and the Supplemental Arbitration Rules defined in 
Section 9(b) below. If there is a conflict between the General Arbitration Rules and the 
Supplemental Arbitration Rules, the Supplemental Arbitration Rules will control.
Either party can seek to have a claim resolved in small claims court if the rules of that court 
will allow it. Additionally, if the claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration 
could have been brought in small claims court, then either you or College Board may elect to 
have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before an 
arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing. Any dispute 
about whether a claim qualifies for small claims court will be resolved by that court and not 
by an arbitrator. In the event that either party elects to have their claims heard in small claims 
court, the arbitration proceeding will remain closed unless and until there is a decision by the 
small claims court that the claim should proceed in arbitration.
All claims that are not decided in small claims court must be resolved through binding, 
individual arbitration before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the 
American Arbitration Association (“ AAA ” ) under the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, 
supplemented by the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules as applicable, in effect at the 
time a request for arbitration is filed with the AAA. Copies of the AAA Consumer Arbitration 
Rules and the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules are located at adr.org. The arbitrator 
will have the authority to resolve any dispute regarding the scope or enforceability of these 
Rules, except only a court can decide claims that a party violated the intellectual property rights 
of the other party. In addition, only a court can decide issues relating to (a) the pre-arbitration 
requirements contained in these Rules or (b) the interpretation of the prohibition of class and 
representative actions contained in these Rules.

Before commencing a small claims court or arbitration proceeding, that party (the 
“complainant” ) must provide the other party (the “respondent” ) with a written notice of 
dispute that includes the complainant’s name and contact information, a detailed description 
of the dispute, relevant documents, the specific relief sought, and the complainant’s 
physical signature (signature by counsel to the party is not sufficient). For purposes of 
clarity and as stated above, this includes disputes relating to the Score Validity Process 
set forth below in Subsection 9(b). If you are the complainant, send the notice of dispute 
by first class mail, FedEx, or UPS. Prior to September 2025, please address to Legal 
Department, 250 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10281. After September 2025, please address 
to Legal Department, 225 Liberty Street, New York, NY, 10281. Alternatively, you (or your 
counsel) can send the notice of dispute to legalhelp@collegeboard.org. A member of 
College Board’s Legal Department will then contact you (or your counsel) to attempt to resolve 
the dispute through informal good faith negotiations as described below. College Board will 
send its notice of dispute to your address as reflected in College Board’s records.
Also, before the complainant may commence a small claims court or arbitration proceeding, 
the parties must attempt to resolve the dispute through informal, good-faith negotiation. If 
the parties have not resolved the dispute within sixty (60) days of the respondent’s receipt 
of the written notice of dispute, the parties will mutually schedule a settlement conference 
which must occur within fourteen (14) days of the completion of the sixty (60) day period, 
unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Each party must personally appear at the 
settlement conference (if a party is represented by counsel, their counsel may also participate), 
and appearances may be made telephonically or by video. If the parties are unable to resolve 
the dispute at the settlement conference, either party may commence arbitration or file a 
small claims court proceeding. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be 
tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. If any aspect of 
the requirements in this Subsection 9(a) has not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or 
prosecution of an arbitration or the assessment of any arbitration fees. In addition, unless 
prohibited by law, the AAA cannot accept or administer an arbitration, nor assess any fees for 
an arbitration, that has not met the requirements of this Subsection 9(a). If the arbitration is 
already pending, it must be dismissed.
If the dispute proceeds to arbitration, the complainant must personally attend all arbitration 
conferences, hearings, and mediations scheduled by the AAA or by an arbitrator or mediator 
appointed by the AAA. If the complainant is represented by counsel, the complainant’s counsel 
may also participate, and all participation may be made telephonically or by video except 
as directed by the arbitrator or mediator. If a complainant fails to personally appear at any 
conference, hearing, or mediation scheduled by the AAA or by an AAA arbitrator or mediator, 
regardless of whether the complainant’s counsel attends, the arbitrator will administratively 
close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless the complainant shows good cause as 
to why the complainant was not able to attend the conference, hearing, or mediation.
This arbitration will be conducted as a documents-only arbitration (i.e., there will be no 
in-person or telephonic hearing) unless otherwise agreed by the parties or required by the 
arbitrator. If the parties agree to or the arbitrator requires proceedings, such proceedings 
should be conducted at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties with due 
consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are 
unable to agree on a location, the parties agree that the proceedings will be conducted via 
a video or telephonic call or, in the event that face-to-face proceedings are agreed to by the 
parties or required by the arbitrator, at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties 
in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator may consider rulings 
in arbitrations involving other individuals, but an arbitrator’s rulings will not be binding 
in proceedings involving different individuals. The existence and content of the arbitration 
proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties; any correspondence 
from the AAA; and correspondence, orders, and awards issued by the arbitrator, will remain 
strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party without the express written 
consent from the other party, unless disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the 
context of conducting the arbitration proceedings or related court proceedings.
For disputes meeting the definition of “Mass Arbitration” under the AAA Mass Arbitration 
Supplementary Rules, the parties agree that the dispute is subject to the AAA’s Mass 
Arbitration Supplementary Rules and the parties agree to the appointment of a Process 
Arbitrator, except as may otherwise be decided by the arbitrator or the AAA.

The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA ”) 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. governs this 
section, and it is the intent of the parties that the FAA will preempt all State laws to the fullest 
extent permitted by law.
No arbitration may be maintained as a class or collective action; a party may bring a claim 
only on their own behalf and cannot seek a relief that would affect other individuals. Unless 
all parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator will not have the authority to consolidate the 
claims of more than 1 individual, conduct any class or collective proceeding, make any class 
or collective award, or make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration, 
without the express written consent of College Board.
Payment of all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the 
AAA’s rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought 
was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth 
in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then College Board may seek applicable fee-shifting.
b. Supplemental Arbitration Rules for the Score Validity Process (”Supplemental Arbitration Rules”)
If you receive a notice from College Board that your scores are subject to the Score Validity 
Process, you may be provided with the option to choose arbitration. In addition to the General 
Arbitration Rules, except as set forth herein, the below rules will apply.
The sole issue for the arbitrator to decide is whether College Board acted in good faith and 
followed the Score Validity Process.
This arbitration will be based only on (i) the documents you submitted to College Board 
pursuant to the Score Validity Process and (ii) College Board documents unless otherwise 
agreed by the parties or required by the arbitrator.
If the arbitrator finds that College Board did not act in good faith in deciding to cancel your 
scores, your scores will not be canceled (or they will be reinstated, if applicable).
All other disputes with College Board will be resolved solely by the General Arbitration Rules 
in Subsection 9(a) above, except as set forth herein.
Section 10. 
Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial
All disputes (disagreements) arising from or related to these rules that are not resolved 
under Section 9 shall be resolved only in the state and federal courts located in New York 
County, New York State, and each party to these rules irrevocably consents to the 
jurisdiction of such courts. Each party expressly waives any right to a jury trial in any 
lawsuit arising from or related to these rules.
Section 11. 
LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT FINALLY DETERMINED TO BE PROHIBITED BY LAW, 
THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF COLLEGE BOARD TO YOU OR ANYONE CLAIMING BY 
OR THROUGH YOU OR ON YOUR BEHALF, FOR ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, COSTS,

TO COLLEGE BOARD, OR ANY TEST ADMINISTRATION BY COLLEGE BOARD, 
FROM ANY CAUSE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TEST REGISTRATION FEES YOU 
PAID TO COLLEGE BOARD (IF APPLICABLE) OR $100.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. 
IN ADDITION, COLLEGE BOARD WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT FOR ANY 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES.
Section 12. 
Disclaimer of Warranties
COLLEGE BOARD MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SAT, SAT CONTENT, 
OR THE APPLICATION INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION A WARRANTY THAT 
THE TESTING EXPERIENCE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. YOU 
ACCEPT THE SAT, SAT CONTENT, AND TESTING APPLICATION AS IS.

Section 13. 
Severability
If any provision or part of these rules is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the 
remaining provisions will nevertheless continue in full force without being impaired or 
invalidated in any way, and, to the extent possible, the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable 
provision shall be modified so that it is valid, legal, and enforceable and, to the fullest extent, 
reflects the intention of the parties.
Section 14. 
Restricted Registrations
College Board, along with our service providers overseas, is subject to U.S. economic 
sanctions, laws, and regulations and is prohibited from providing testing services to, 
or accepting registrations from, persons residing in certain areas or designated by the 
U.S. government as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (collectively, 
“Sanctioned Persons”), unless specifically licensed or otherwise authorized by the U.S. 
government. You consent to use of your personally identifiable information by College Board 
to verify whether you are a Sanctioned Person. If a Sanctioned Person attempts to register 
despite U.S. sanctions that prohibit College Board from doing business with such Sanctioned 
Person, College Board or a U.S. financial institution may block the registration or payments 
submitted by or for such Sanctioned Persons. If payment is not blocked, College Board is 
required to cancel the registration and may not be able to refund the payment. Please contact 
SAT customer service at 866-756-7346 (+1-212-713-7789 internationally) or the website of the 
U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to obtain the current list 
of sanctioned programs and Sanctioned Persons.
