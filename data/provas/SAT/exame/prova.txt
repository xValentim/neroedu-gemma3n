The following text is adapted from Susan Glaspell’s 
1912 short story 
“‘Out There.’” An elderly shop 
owner is looking at a picture that he recently 
acquired and hopes to sell. 
It did seem that the picture failed to fit in with 
the rest of the shop. A persuasive young fellow 
who claimed he was closing out his stock let the 
old man have it for what he called a song. It was 
only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted 
chiefly on the framing of pictures. The old man 
looked around at his views of the city, his 
pictures of cats and dogs, his flaming bits of 
landscape. “Don’t belong in here,” he fumed. 
And yet the old man was secretly proud of his 
acquisition. There was a hidden dignity in his 
scowling as he shuffled about pondering the least 
ridiculous place for the picture. 
Which choice best states the main purpose of the 
text? 
A) To reveal the shop owner’s conflicted feelings 
about the new picture 
B) To convey the shop owner’s resentment of the 
person he got the new picture from 
C) To describe the items that the shop owner most 
highly prizes 
D) To explain differences between the new picture 
and other pictures in the shop

The mimosa tree evolved in East Asia, where the 
beetle Bruchidius terrenus preys on its seeds. In 1785, 
mimosa trees were introduced to North America, far 
from any B. terrenus. 
But evolutionary links between 
predators and their prey can persist across centuries 
and continents. Around 
2001, B. terrenus was 
introduced in southeastern North America near 
where botanist Shu-Mei Chang and colleagues had 
been monitoring mimosa trees. Within a year, 
93 percent of the trees had been attacked by the 
beetles. 
Which 
choice best describes the function of the third 
sentence in the overall structure of the text? 
A) It states the hypothesis that Chang and 
colleagues had set out to investigate using 
mimosa trees and B. terrenus. 
B) It presents a generalization that is exemplified 
by the discussion of the mimosa trees and 
B. terrenus. 
C) It offers an alternative explanation for the 
findings of Chang and colleagues. 
D) It provides context that clarifies why the species 
mentioned spread to new locations.

Text 1 
Conventional wisdom long held that 
human 
social systems evolved in stages, beginning with 
hunter-gatherers forming small bands of members 
with roughly equal status. The shift to agriculture 
about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth 
that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical 
structures: associations of clans first, then chiefdoms, 
and finally, bureaucratic states. 
Text 2 
In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and 
archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans 
have always been socially flexible, alternately forming 
systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with 
decentralized leadership. The authors point to 
evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some 
hunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures 
seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but 
also assembling into communities that included 
esteemed individuals. 
Based on the texts, how would Graeber and 
Wengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the 
“conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1? 
A) By conceding the importance of hierarchical 
systems but asserting the greater significance of 
decentralized collective societies 
B) By disputing the idea that developments in social 
structures have followed a linear progression 
through distinct stages 
C) By acknowledging that hierarchical roles likely 
weren’t a part of social systems before the rise of 
agriculture 
D) By challenging the assumption that groupings of 
hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms 
of social structure

As a fragile and lovely flower unfolds its gleaming 
foliage on the breast of the fostering earth, if 
the dew and the rain draw it forth; 
So doth my tender mind flourish, if it be fed with the

Biologist Valentina Gómez-Bahamón 
and her team 
have investigated two subspecies of the fork-tailed 
flycatcher 
bird that live in the same region in 
Colombia, but one subspecies migrates south for part 
of the year, and the other doesn’t. The researchers 
found that, due to slight differences in feather shape, 
the feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher 
males make a sound during flight that is higher 
pitched than that made by the feathers of 
nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize 
that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the 
specific sound made by the males of their own 
subspecies, and that over time the females’ 
preference will drive further genetic and anatomical 
divergence between the subspecies. 
Which finding, if true, would most directly support 
Gómez-Bahamón 
and her team’s hypothesis? 
A) The feathers located on the wings of the 
migratory fork-tailed flycatchers have a narrower 
shape than those of the nonmigratory birds, 
which allows them to fly long distances. 
B) Over several generations, the sound made by the 
feathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers 
grows progressively higher pitched relative to 
that made by the feathers of nonmigratory 
males. 
C) Fork-tailed flycatchers communicate different 
messages to each other depending on whether 
their feathers create high-pitched or low-pitched 
sounds. 
D) The breeding habits of the migratory and 
nonmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers remained 
generally the same over several generations.

potassium 44% 74% 97% 100% 
sodium 45% 75% 99% 100% 
Earth’s atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic dust 
originating 
from several sources: short-period 
comets (SPCs), particles from the asteroid belt 
(ASTs), Halley-type comets (HTCs), and Oort cloud 
comets (OCCs). Some of the dust’s material 
vaporizes in the atmosphere in a process called 
ablation, and the faster the particles move, the higher 
the rate of ablation. Astrophysicist Juan Diego 
Carrillo-Sánchez led a team that calculated average 
ablation rates for elements in the dust (such as iron 
and potassium) and showed that material in slower-
moving SPC or AST dust has a lower rate than the 
same material in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. 
For example, whereas the average ablation rate 
for iron from AST dust is 28%, the average rate 
for _______

Art collectives, like the United States-and Vietnam-
based collective The Propeller Group or Cuba’s Los 
Carpinteros, are 
groups of artists who agree to work 
together: perhaps for stylistic reasons, or to advance 
certain shared political ideals, or to help mitigate the 
costs of supplies and studio space. Regardless of 
the reasons, art collectives usually involve some 
collaboration among the artists. Based on a recent 
series of interviews with various art collectives, an 
arts journalist claims that this can be difficult for 
artists who are often used to having sole control over 
their work. 
Which quotation from the interviews best illustrates 
the journalist’s claim? 
A) “The first collective I joined included many 
amazingly talented artists, and we enjoyed each 
other’s company, but because we had a hard time 
sharing credit and responsibility for our work, 
the collective didn’t last.” 
B) “We work together, but that doesn’t mean that 
individual projects are equally the work of all of 
us. Many of our projects are primarily the 
responsibility of whoever originally proposed the 
work to the group.” 
C) “Having worked as a member of a collective for 
several years, it’s sometimes hard to recall what it 
was like to work alone without the collective’s 
support. But that support encourages my 
individual expression rather than limits it.” 
D) “Sometimes an artist from outside the collective 
will choose to collaborate with us on a project, 
but all of those projects fit within the larger 
themes of the work the collective does on its 
own.”

Some bird species don’t raise their own chicks. 
Instead, adult females lay their eggs in other nests, 
next to another bird species’ own eggs. 
Female 
cuckoos have been seen quickly laying eggs in the 
nests of other bird species when those birds are out 
looking for food. 
After the eggs hatch, the noncuckoo 
parents will typically raise the cuckoo chicks as if 
they were their own offspring, even if the cuckoos 
look very different from the other chicks. 
Which 
choice best describes the function of the

A) It introduces a physical feature of female 
cuckoos that is described later in the text. 
B) It describes the appearance of the cuckoo nests

Cats can judge unseen people’s positions in space by 
the sound of their voices and thus react 
with surprise 
when the same person calls to them from two 
different locations in a short span of time. Saho 
Takagi and colleagues reached this conclusion by 
measuring cats’ levels of surprise based on their ear 
and head movements while the cats heard recordings 
of their owners’ voices from two speakers spaced far 
apart. Cats exhibited a low level of surprise when 
owners’ voices were played twice from the same 
speaker, but they showed a high level of surprise 
when the voice was played once each from the two 
different speakers. 
According to the text, how did the researchers 
determine the level of surprise displayed by the cats 
in the study? 
A) They watched how each cat moved its ears and 
head. 
B) They examined how each cat reacted to the voice 
of a stranger. 
C) They studied how each cat physically interacted 
with its owner. 
D) They tracked how each cat moved around the

A student performs an experiment testing her 
hypothesis that a slightly 
acidic soil environment is 
more beneficial for the growth of the plant Brassica 
rapa parachinensis (a vegetable commonly known as 
choy sum) than a neutral soil environment. She 
plants sixteen seeds of choy sum in a mixture of 
equal amounts of coffee grounds (which are highly 
acidic) and potting soil and another sixteen seeds in 
potting soil without coffee grounds as the control for 
the experiment. The two groups of seeds were 
exposed to the same growing conditions and 
monitored for three weeks. 
Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken 
the student’s hypothesis? 
A) The choy sum planted in the soil without coffee 
grounds were significantly taller at the end of the 
experiment than the choy sum planted in the 
mixture of soil and coffee grounds. 
B) The choy sum grown in the soil without coffee 
grounds weighed significantly less at the end of 
the experiment than the choy sum grown in the 
mixture of soil and coffee grounds. 
C) The choy sum seeds planted in the soil without 
coffee grounds sprouted significantly later in the 
experiment than did the seeds planted in the 
mixture of soil and coffee grounds. 
D) Significantly fewer of the choy sum seeds planted

I moved them away.” 
B) “While we waited she took out a little, gold 
powder-box with a mirror in the lid, shook the 
poor little puff as though she loathed it, and 
dabbed her lovely nose.” 
C) “I saw, after that, she couldn’t stand this place a 
moment longer, and, indeed, she jumped up and 
turned away while I went through the vulgar act 
of paying for the tea.” 
D) “She didn’t even take her gloves off. She lowered 
her eyes and drummed on the table. When a 
faint violin sounded she winced and bit her lip 
again. Silence.”

tax and public spending policy
trade policy
general economic policy
13 
High levels of public uncertainty about which 
economic policies a country will adopt can make 
planning difficult for businesses, but measures of 
such uncertainty have not tended to be very detailed. 
Recently, however, economist Sandile Hlatshwayo 
analyzed trends in news reports to derive measures 
not only for general economic policy uncertainty but 
also for uncertainty related to specific areas of 
economic policy, like tax or trade policy. One 
revelation of her work is that a general measure may 
not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of 
policy, as in the case of the United Kingdom, where 
general economic policy uncertainty _______ 
Which choice most effectively uses data from the

and 
public spending policy in 2005 but differed from 
uncertainty about tax and public spending policy

B) was substantially lower than uncertainty about 
tax and public spending policy each year from 
2005 to 2010. 
C) reached its highest level between 2005 and 2010 
in the same year that uncertainty about trade 
policy and tax and public spending policy 
reached their lowest levels.

Linguist Deborah Tannen has cautioned against 
framing contentious issues in terms 
of two highly 
competitive perspectives, such as pro versus con. 
According to Tannen, this debate-driven approach 
can strip issues of their complexity and, when used in 
front of an audience, can be less informative than 
the presentation of multiple perspectives in a 
noncompetitive format. To test Tannen’s hypothesis, 
students conducted a study in which they showed 
participants one of three different versions of local 
news commentary about the same issue. Each 
version featured a debate between two commentators 
with opposing views, a panel of three commentators 
with various views, or a single commentator. 
Which finding from the students’ study, if true, 
would most strongly support Tannen’s hypothesis? 
A) On average, participants perceived 
commentators in the debate as more 
knowledgeable about the issue than 
commentators in the panel. 
B) On average, participants perceived 
commentators in the panel as more 
knowledgeable about the issue than the single 
commentator. 
C) On average, participants who watched the panel 
correctly answered more questions about the 
issue than those who watched the debate or the 
single commentator did. 
D) On average, participants who watched the single 
commentator correctly answered more questions 
about the issue than those who watched the 
debate did.

Many of William Shakespeare’s tragedies address 
broad themes that still appeal to today’s audiences. 
For instance, Romeo and Juliet, which is set in the 
Italy of Shakespeare’s time, tackles the themes of 
parents versus children and love versus hate, and 
the play continues to be read and produced 
widely around the world. But understanding 
Shakespeare’s so-called history plays can require a 
knowledge of several centuries of English history. 
Consequently, _______

Ancestral Puebloans, the civilization from which 
present-day Pueblo tribes descended, emerged as 
early as 
1500 B.C.E. in an area of what is now the 
southwestern United States and dispersed suddenly 
in the late 1200s C.E., abandoning established 
villages with systems for farming crops and turkeys. 
Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa 
Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to 
samples from modern turkey populations in the 
Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico 
determined that the latter birds descended in part 
from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared 
genetic markers appearing only after 1280. Thus,

While researching a topic, a student has taken the 
following notes: 
• The calendar used by most 
of the world (the 
Gregorian calendar) has 365 days. 
• Because 365 days can’t be divided evenly by 7 (the 
number of days in a week), calendar dates fall on a 
different day of the week each year. 
• The Hanke-Henry permanent calendar, developed 
as an alternative to the Gregorian calendar, has 
364 days. 
• Because 364 can be divided evenly by 7, calendar 
dates fall on the same day of the week each year, 
which supports more predictable scheduling. 
The student wants to explain an advantage of the 
Hanke-Henry calendar. Which choice most

While researching a topic, a student has taken the 
following notes: 
• In 1999, astronomer Todd Henry studied the 
differences in 
surface temperature between the 
Sun and nearby stars. 
• His team mapped all stars within 10 parsecs 
(approximately 200 trillion miles) of the Sun. 
• The surface temperature of the Sun is around 
9,800°F, which classifies it as a G star. 
• 327 of the 
357 stars in the study were classified as 
K or M stars, with surface temperatures under 
8,900°F (cooler than the Sun). 
• 11 of the 357 stars in the study were classified as A 
or F stars, with surface temperatures greater than 
10,300°F (hotter than the Sun). 
The student wants to emphasize how hot the Sun 
is relative to nearby stars. Which choice most 
effectively uses relevant information from the notes 
to accomplish this goal? 
A) At around 9,800°F, which classifies it as a G star, 
the 
Sun is hotter than most but not all of the 
stars within 10 parsecs of it. 
B) Astronomer Todd 
Henry determined that the 
Sun, at around 9,800°F, is a G star, and several 
other 
stars within a 10-parsec range are A or F 
stars. 
C) Of the 
357 stars within ten parsecs of the Sun, 
327 are classified as K or M stars, with surface 
temperatures under 8,900°F. 
D) While most of the stars within 10 parsecs of the 
Sun are classified as K, M, A, or F stars, the Sun 
is classified as a G star due to its surface 
temperature of 9,800°F.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the 
following notes: 
• The Atlantic Monthly magazine was first 
published in 1857. 
• The magazine focused on politics, art, and 
literature. 
• In 2019, historian Cathryn Halverson published 
the book Faraway Women and the “Atlantic 
Monthly.” 
• Its subject is female authors whose 
autobiographies appeared in the magazine in the 
early 1900s. 
• One of the authors discussed is Juanita Harrison. 
The student wants to introduce Cathryn Halverson’s 
book to an audience already familiar with the 
Atlantic Monthly. Which choice most effectively uses 
relevant information from the notes to accomplish 
this goal? 
A) Cathryn Halverson’s Faraway Women and the 
“Atlantic Monthly” discusses female authors 
whose autobiographies appeared in the magazine 
in the early 1900s. 
B) A magazine called the Atlantic Monthly, referred 
to in Cathryn Halverson’s book title, was first 
published in 1857. 
C) Faraway Women and the “Atlantic Monthly” 
features contributors to the Atlantic Monthly, 
first published in 1857 as a magazine focusing on 
politics, art, and literature. 
D) An author discussed by Cathryn Halverson is 
Juanita Harrison, whose autobiography appeared 
in the Atlantic Monthly in the early 1900s.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the 
following notes: 
• The magnificent frigatebird (fregata magnificens) 
is a species of seabird that feeds mainly on fish, 
tuna, squid, and other small sea animals. 
• It is unusual among seabirds in that it doesn’t dive 
into the water for prey. 
• One way it acquires food is by using its 
hook-tipped bill to snatch prey from the surface of 
the water. 
• Another way it acquires food is by taking it from 
weaker birds by force. 
• This behavior is known as kleptoparasitism. 
The student wants to emphasize a similarity between 
the two ways a magnificent frigatebird acquires food. 
Which choice most effectively uses relevant 
information from the notes to accomplish this goal? 
A) A magnificent frigatebird never dives into the 
water, instead using its hook-tipped bill to 
snatch prey from the surface. 
B) Neither of a magnificent frigatebird’s two ways 
of acquiring food requires the bird to dive into 
the water. 
C) Of the magnificent frigatebird’s two ways of 
acquiring food, only one is known as 
kleptoparasitism. 
D) In addition to snatching prey from the water 
with its hook-tipped bill, a magnificent 
frigatebird takes food from other birds by force.
